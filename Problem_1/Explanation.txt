The database design includes primary tables such as Customers, Addresses, and Products, each with essential attributes. The Customers table contains CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, and PhoneNumber, uniquely identified by CustomerID. The Addresses table includes AddressID, CustomerID, Street, City, State, ZipCode, and Country, with AddressID as the primary key and CustomerID as a foreign key referencing the Customers table. The Products table holds ProductID, ProductName, and Category, with ProductID as the primary key. This structure ensures data normalization, reducing redundancy and improving data integrity by storing each piece of information in its appropriate table.

Design choices were made to enhance relational integrity and efficient data management. Primary keys ensure unique identification of records, while foreign keys maintain referential integrity between related tables, such as linking customer addresses to their corresponding customer entries. Data types like VARCHAR and TEXT are chosen based on the expected data format and size, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. This design supports scalable data operations and maintains a clear, organized structure, making it easier to manage, query, and update the database.
